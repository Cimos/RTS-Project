// Idea is to create a thread that can be init to different i2c ports with different i2c addrs.
// You can then register a call back that will get called everytime there is a key press...
// There isnt a limit on the number of callbacks that you register..... This could then be inited
// by a main function and then multiple threads can register to get updates????
